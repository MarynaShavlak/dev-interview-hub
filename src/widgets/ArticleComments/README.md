# ArticleComments Feature

## Overview
The **`ArticleComments`** component is designed to display and manage user comments for a specific article. It integrates with the application's state management to fetch and render comments, while also providing a form for users to add new comments. The component adapts its UI based on feature flags, ensuring consistency with both the legacy and redesigned versions of the application. It also handles loading states and potential errors, offering a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Type Definition
```typescript
export interface ArticleCommentsProps {
    className?: string;
    id?: string;
}
```
## Props
The **`ArticleComments`** component accepts the following props:

| Prop        | Type       | Required / Optional | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | `string`   | Optional            | Identifier for the article to fetch comments.        |
| `className` | `string`   | Optional            | Custom class name for additional styling.            |


## Features
1. **Comment Fetching and Display**: Automatically fetches and displays comments for the specified article using the `fetchCommentsByArticleId` service. Comments are displayed in a list format, with support for loading and error states.

2. **Add Comment Functionality**: Provides a form for users to submit new comments. The submission is handled by the `addCommentForArticle` service, which updates the comment list upon success.

3. **Feature Flag Adaptation**: Uses the `ToggleFeaturesComponent` to adjust the UI based on whether the application is using the redesigned interface (`isAppRedesigned` feature flag). This ensures the component remains visually consistent with the rest of the application.

4. **Localization Support**: Utilizes the `useTranslation` hook to provide localization for the section title, ensuring the component is adaptable to different languages.

5. **State Management**: Integrates with Redux to manage the loading state, errors, and the list of comments, providing a responsive and reliable user experience.

6. **Lazy Loading**: The component is lazy-loaded to optimize performance. By loading the component only when needed, it reduces the initial load time of the application, improving the user experience.


## Usage Example
```typescript jsx
import ArticleComments from '@/features/ArticleComments';

const ArticlePage = () => (
    <div>
        {/* The ArticleComments component allows users to view and add comments on the article */}
        <ArticleComments id="12345" className="my-custom-class" />
    </div>
);
```

## Conclusion
The **`ArticleComments`** component is a robust solution for handling user comments within an article. It seamlessly integrates with the application's state management to fetch and display comments, while also allowing users to add their own input through the provided form. By supporting feature flags, the component ensures consistency across different versions of the application's UI. Additionally, the component is designed with localization in mind, making it adaptable to various languages.

The component also incorporates lazy loading to optimize performance. By using React's `lazy` and `Suspense`, the component is loaded only when needed, reducing the initial load time of the application and improving the overall user experience. With its comprehensive handling of loading and error states, functionality for adding new comments, and performance optimization through lazy loading, the `ArticleComments` component delivers a reliable and user-friendly experience, enhancing user engagement through interactive content.
