# ListViewSkeleton

## Overview
The **`ListViewSkeleton`** component dynamically renders a skeleton placeholder for list view items, switching between redesigned and deprecated styles based on the `isAppRedesigned` feature flag. This component ensures a consistent loading experience for users while content is being fetched, providing visual feedback that maintains engagement and reduces perceived wait times.

## Features
1. **Feature Flag Driven**: The component adapts between the redesigned and deprecated skeleton views based on the `isAppRedesigned` feature flag, allowing for seamless transitions between different design systems.
2. **Dynamic Skeleton Styles**: Utilizes the `toggleFeatures` function to conditionally render either the redesigned or deprecated skeleton styles based on the `isAppRedesigned` feature flag. This ensures the skeleton component aligns with the current design standards of the application.
3. **Consistent Layout**: Maintains a consistent layout and visual structure for list items during loading states, ensuring a uniform user experience.
4. **Flexibility with Classes**: Utilizes utility functions like `getFlexClasses` and `classNames` to manage class names dynamically, enhancing the flexibility and maintainability of the component.

## Usage Example
```typescript jsx
import { ListViewSkeleton } from '@/entities/Article';

const App = () => (
    <div className="article-list">
        <ListViewSkeleton />
        <ListViewSkeleton />
        <ListViewSkeleton />
    </div>
);
```

## Conclusion
The `ListViewSkeleton` component is essential for rendering placeholder skeletons in a list layout, providing a flexible and adaptive interface that caters to both legacy and modern design systems. 
By leveraging the `isAppRedesigned` feature flag, the component seamlessly transitions between the `RedesignedListViewSkeleton` and `DeprecatedListViewSkeleton` components, ensuring users receive a consistent and visually appealing loading experience irrespective of the application's design state. 
This adaptability not only enhances user experience during loading phases but also supports the application's evolution, allowing for smooth upgrades and interface changes without disrupting the user interface. 
The `ListViewSkeleton` component thus plays a crucial role in maintaining engagement and visual consistency, supporting both current and future design paradigms.
