# Documentation for 'addCommentFormSlice'

## Overview
The `addCommentFormSlice` is a part of the Redux state management designed to handle the state of a comment form in an application.
It leverages Redux Toolkit and a custom `buildSlice` function to create a slice with an initial state and reducers. 
This slice primarily manages the text input for the comment form and any associated errors.

## Import Statements
```typescript
import { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { buildSlice } from '@/shared/lib/store';
import { UIScrollSchema } from '../types/ScrollSchema';
```
- `PayloadAction`: A type from Redux Toolkit used to define the shape of action payloads.
- `buildSlice`: A custom utility function for creating Redux slices.
- `AddCommentFormSchema`: A TypeScript type that defines the schema for the comment form state.

## Initial State
```typescript
const initialState: AddCommentFormSchema = {
  text: '',
};
```

The initial state of the slice is defined using the `AddCommentFormSchema` type. It contains a single property `text`, which is initialized as an empty string. This property will hold the text entered into the comment form.

## Slice Definition
```typescript
export const addCommentFormSlice = buildSlice({
  name: 'addCommentForm',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setText: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
      state.text = action.payload;
    },
  },
});
```
- **name**: The name of the slice, which is **'addCommentForm'**.
- **initialState**: The initial state defined earlier.
- **reducers**: An object containing reducer functions.

### Reducer: setText
```typescript
setText: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
  state.text = action.payload;
}
```
- **state**: The current state of the slice.
- **action:**: An object containing:
  - **payload**: A string representing the new text for the comment form.
This reducer updates the `text` property in the state with the value provided in the action payload.

## Exports
```typescript
export const {
  actions: addCommentFormActions,
  reducer: addCommentFormReducer,
  useActions: useAddCommentFormActions,
} = addCommentFormSlice;
```
- **addCommentFormActions**: An object containing the action creators generated by the slice.
- **addCommentFormReducer**: The reducer function to be used in the Redux store.
- **useAddCommentFormActions**: A custom hook to use the actions in a React component.


## Usage Example
```typescript
import { addCommentFormActions, addCommentFormReducer } from '@/path/to/addCommentFormSlice';
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    addCommentForm: addCommentFormReducer,
  },
});

// Dispatching an action to set the text of the comment form
const { setText } = useAddCommentFormActions();
setText('This is a new comment');
```

## Conclusion
The `addCommentFormSlice` is an essential part of the Redux state management in applications where user comments are collected through forms. By encapsulating the comment form's state and providing a straightforward way to update the comment text, this slice simplifies the handling of user inputs and error states. 
Leveraging `buildSlice` function, it ensures a scalable and maintainable approach to managing form states. 
Integrating this slice into your Redux store and using the provided actions can significantly streamline the process of handling comment form data in your application.
