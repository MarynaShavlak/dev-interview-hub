# Router Types
## Enum: `AppRoutes`

The `AppRoutes` enum defines a set of named routes used throughout the application. 
Each route corresponds to a specific path and is represented as a string value. 
This enum helps in maintaining consistent route references and avoiding hard-coded strings scattered throughout the codebase.
```typescript
export enum AppRoutes {
    MAIN = 'main',
    SETTINGS = 'settings',
    ABOUT = 'about',
    PROFILE = 'profile',
    ARTICLES = 'articles',
    ARTICLE_DETAILS = 'article_details',
    ARTICLE_CREATE = 'article_create',
    ARTICLE_EDIT = 'article_edit',
    ADMIN_PANEL = 'admin_panel',
    FORBIDDEN = 'forbidden',
    NOT_FOUND = 'not_found',
}
```
- `MAIN`: Route for the main page.
- `SETTINGS`: Route for the settings page.
- `ABOUT`: Route for the about page.
- `PROFILE`: Route for the profile page, which requires a user ID.
- `ARTICLES`: Route for the articles list page.
- `ARTICLE_DETAILS`: Route for the details of a specific article, which requires an article ID.
- `ARTICLE_CREATE`: Route for creating a new article.
- `ARTICLE_EDIT`: Route for editing a specific article, which requires an article ID.
- `ADMIN_PANEL`: Route for the admin panel.
- `FORBIDDEN`: Route for pages with restricted access.
- `NOT_FOUND`: Route for pages that are not found.


### Route Helper Functions
These functions provide convenient access to the route paths used in the application. 
They generate the URLs based on specific parameters where required.
```typescript
export const getRouteMain = () => '/';
export const getRouteSettings = () => '/settings';
export const getRouteAbout = () => '/about';
export const getRouteProfile = (id: string) => `/profile/${id}`;
export const getRouteArticles = () => '/articles';
export const getRouteArticleDetails = (id: string) => `/articles/${id}`;
export const getRouteArticleCreate = () => '/articles/new';
export const getRouteArticleEdit = (id: string) => `/articles/${id}/edit`;
export const getRouteAdmin = () => '/admin';
export const getRouteForbidden = () => '/forbidden';
```
- `getRouteMain()`: Returns the path for the main page.
- `getRouteSettings()`: Returns the path for the settings page.
- `getRouteAbout()`: Returns the path for the about page.
- `getRouteProfile(id: string)`: Returns the path for the profile page with a user ID.
- `getRouteArticles()`: Returns the path for the articles list page.
- `getRouteArticleDetails(id: string)`: Returns the path for the article details page with an article ID.
- `getRouteArticleCreate()`: Returns the path for creating a new article.
- `getRouteArticleEdit(id: string)`: Returns the path for editing an article with an article ID.
- `getRouteAdmin()`: Returns the path for the admin panel.
- `getRouteForbidden()`: Returns the path for the forbidden access page.

## Route Pattern Mapping
The `AppRouteByPathPattern` object maps route paths to their corresponding `AppRoutes` enum values. 
This mapping allows for easy conversion between route paths and their associated enum identifiers.
 - The keys of A`ppRouteByPathPattern` are the route paths generated by the helper functions.
 - The values are the corresponding `AppRoutes` enum values.
 - 
```typescript
export const AppRouteByPathPattern: Record<string, AppRoutes> = {
    [getRouteMain()]: AppRoutes.MAIN,
    [getRouteSettings()]: AppRoutes.SETTINGS,
    [getRouteAbout()]: AppRoutes.ABOUT,
    [getRouteProfile(':id')]: AppRoutes.PROFILE,
    [getRouteArticles()]: AppRoutes.ARTICLES,
    [getRouteArticleDetails(':id')]: AppRoutes.ARTICLE_DETAILS,
    [getRouteArticleCreate()]: AppRoutes.ARTICLE_CREATE,
    [getRouteArticleEdit(':id')]: AppRoutes.ARTICLE_EDIT,
    [getRouteAdmin()]: AppRoutes.ADMIN_PANEL,
    [getRouteForbidden()]: AppRoutes.FORBIDDEN,
};
```
This mapping is useful for translating URL paths into their semantic route identifiers, which can be used for routing logic and navigation throughout the application.
