# Documentation for '_buildSelector_' Function
## Overview
The **_'buildSelector'_** function is designed to simplify interaction with the Redux state in a React application. Specifically, it allows developers to bind dispatch actions and state selectors directly to data, reducing the need to repeatedly use hooks like **_'useSelector'_** and **_'useDispatch'_** in components.


## Purpose
In a typical Redux setup, components frequently need to use the **_'useSelector'_** hook to select data from the state and the **_'useDispatch'_** hook to dispatch actions. This can lead to repetitive and less convenient code. The **_'buildSelector'_** function provides a mechanism to streamline these operations by wrapping the selector and dispatch actions, allowing direct access to state data and dispatch actions without manually invoking **_'useSelector'_** and **_'useDispatch'_** in every component.

## Function Definition
**Imports**
```typescript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { StateSchema } from '@/app/providers/StoreProvider';
```

**Type Definitions**
```typescript
type Selector<T> = (state: StateSchema) => T;
type Result<T> = [() => T, Selector<T>];
```
- **_Selector<T>_**: A function type that takes the application state (**_'StateSchema'_**) and returns a value of type **_'T'_**.
- **_Result<T>_**: A tuple type that consists of a custom hook to use the selector and the selector itself.

**Function Implementation**
```typescript
export function buildSelector<T>(selector: Selector<T>): Result<T> {
    const useSelectorHook = () => {
        return useSelector(selector);
    };

    return [useSelectorHook, selector];
}
```
**Parameters**
- **_'selector'_**: A function of type **_'Selector<T>'_** that takes the state and returns a piece of state data of type **_'T'_**.

**Returns**
- A tuple **_'Result<T>'_**:
    - The first element is a custom hook (**_'useSelectorHook'_**) that internally uses the **_'useSelector'_** hook with the provided selector.
    - The second element is the original selector function.

## Usage
### Example
**Defining a Selector**
Assume you have a state schema where you want to select a user's name.
```typescript
const selectUserName: Selector<string> = (state: StateSchema) => state.user.name
```
**Building the Selector Hook**

Use the **_'buildSelector'_** function to create a custom hook and get the selector.
```typescript
const [useUserName, userNameSelector] = buildSelector(selectUserName);
```
**Using in a Component**
Now, you can use the **_'useUserName'_** hook in your component without directly invoking **_'useSelector'_**.
```typescript
import React from 'react';

const UserProfile = () => {
    const userName = useUserName();

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{userName}</h1>
        </div>
    );
};
```
This approach reduces boilerplate and keeps your components clean and focused on rendering logic rather than state management intricacies.

## Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Reduces the need to use **_'useSelector'_** directly in components.
- **Reusability**: Allows selectors to be defined once and reused across multiple components.
- **Readability**: Improves the readability of components by abstracting away the state selection logic.

## Conclusion
The **_'buildSelector'_** function is a useful utility for developers working with Redux in React applications. It abstracts and simplifies the process of accessing state and dispatching actions, making components cleaner and more maintainable.
