# Documentation for '_buildSelector_' Function
## Overview
The `buildSelector` function is a helper designed to simplify interactions with the Redux state in a React application. It allows developers to create a custom hook that can accept arguments and return a specific piece of state based on those arguments. This eliminates the need to repeatedly use the`useSelector` hook in components, streamlining state access and enhancing code readability.


## Purpose
In a typical Redux setup, components frequently need to use the `useSelector` hook to select data from the state. However, there may be scenarios where you need to pass arguments to the selector to retrieve specific data. The `buildSelector` function provides a mechanism to create selectors that can accept arguments, allowing for more flexible and reusable state selection logic.

## Function Definition
**Imports**
```typescript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { StateSchema } from '@/app/providers/StoreProvider';
```

**Type Definitions**
```typescript
type Selector<T, Args extends any[]> = (state: StateSchema, ...args: Args) => T;
type Hook<T, Args extends any[]> = (...args: Args) => T;
type Result<T, Args extends any[]> = [Hook<T, Args>, Selector<T, Args>];
```
- **_Selector<T, Args extends any[]>_**: A function type that takes the application state (`StateSchema`) and additional arguments, returning a value of type `T`.
- **_Hook<T, Args extends any[]>_**: A custom hook type that takes arguments and returns a value of type `T`.
- **_Result<T, Args extends any[]>_**: A tuple consisting of the custom hook and the selector function.

> In TypeScript, `Args extends any[]` is a constraint that defines `Args` as an array where each element can be of any type, enabling `buildSelector` tto handle selectors with varied argument types and quantities for dynamic Redux state management.

> This approach supports creating selectors like `selectUserProfile: Selector<UserProfile, [string]>` for fetching user profiles by ID or `selectFilteredData: Selector<Data[], [number, string]>` for filtering data based on criteria, enhancing Redux selectors' adaptability and code clarity in TypeScript.

**Function Implementation**
```typescript
export function buildSelector<T, Args extends any[]>(
    selector: Selector<T, Args>,
): Result<T, Args> {
    const useSelectorHook: Hook<T, Args> = (...args: Args) => {
        return useSelector((state: StateSchema) => selector(state, ...args));
    };

    return [useSelectorHook, selector];
}
```



**Parameters**
- `selector`: A function of type `Selector<T, Args>` that takes the state and additional arguments, returning a piece of state data of type `T`.

**Returns**
- A tuple `Result<T, Args>`:
  - The first element is a custom hook (`useSelectorHook`) that internally uses the `useSelector` hook with the provided selector and arguments.
  - The second element is the original selector function.

## Usage
### Example 1: Retrieving User Name
**Defining a Selector**
Assume you have a state schema where you want to select a user's name.
```typescript
const selectUserName: Selector<string> = (state: StateSchema) => state.user.name
```
**Building the Selector Hook**

Use the `buildSelector` function to create a custom hook and get the selector.
```typescript
const [useUserName, userNameSelector] = buildSelector(selectUserName);
```
**Using in a Component**

Now, you can use the `useUserName` hook in your component without directly invoking `useSelector`.
```typescript
import React from 'react';

const UserProfile = () => {
    const userName = useUserName();

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{userName}</h1>
        </div>
    );
};
```
### Example 2: Retrieving Article by ID
**Defining a Selector**
Assume you have a state schema where you want to select an article by its ID.
```typescript
const selectArticleById: Selector<Article, string> = (state: StateSchema, id: string) => state.articles[id]
```
**Building the Selector Hook**

Use the `buildSelector` function to create a custom hook and get the selector.
```typescript
const [useArticleById, articleByIdSelector] = buildSelector(selectArticleById);
```
**Using in a Component**

Now, you can use the `useArticleById` hook in your component, passing the required argument
```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';

const ArticleComponent = ({ articleId }) => {
    const article = useArticleById(articleId);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{article.title}</h1>
            <p>{article.content}</p>
        </div>
    );
};
```

In these examples, buildSelector facilitates the creation of custom hooks (`useUserName` and `useArticleById`) that encapsulate the logic for selecting specific pieces of state (`user.name` and an article by ID) from the Redux store. This approach improves code organization, reduces boilerplate, and enhances reusability across React components by abstracting away the intricacies of state selection with Redux.

## Advantages
- **Flexibility**: Allows selectors to accept arguments, making them more versatile.
- **Reusability**: Enables the creation of reusable hooks that can be used across multiple components.
- **Readability**: Improves the readability of components by abstracting away the state selection logic.

## Conclusion
The `buildSelector` function is a valuable utility for developers working with Redux in React applications. It abstracts and simplifies the process of accessing state with arguments, making components cleaner and more maintainable. This function is especially useful for scenarios where selectors need to dynamically select data based on provided arguments, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of state management in your application.
