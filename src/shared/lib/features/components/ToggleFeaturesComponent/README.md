# ToggleFeaturesComponent

The `ToggleFeaturesComponent` is a versatile React component designed to facilitate feature flag management by enabling conditional rendering based on feature flag states. This component is particularly useful for implementing feature toggles in a clean, maintainable manner, allowing developers to manage feature rollouts and deprecations effectively.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `ToggleFeaturesComponent` is to provide a streamlined way to toggle between different React elements depending on whether a specific feature flag is enabled or not. By encapsulating this logic within a component, it promotes cleaner code and simplifies the process of managing feature flags throughout the application.

## Importance
- **Clean Code Management**: Simplifies conditional rendering and logic based on feature flags.
- **Easy Feature Toggling**: Allows seamless switching between feature implementations.
- **Code Maintainability**: Reduces code duplication and complexity by centralizing feature flag logic.

## Role
The `ToggleFeaturesComponent` plays a critical role in feature flag management by encapsulating the conditional rendering logic required to toggle features. It checks the state of a feature flag and renders the appropriate React element (`on` or `off`) based on whether the flag is enabled or not.

## Parameters:
**Note:** All parameters are required.

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                     |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `feature`    | `keyof FeatureFlags` | The name of the feature flag to toggle.  |
| `on`      | `() => T` | The React element to render when the feature flag is enabled. |
| `off`     | `() => T` | The React element to render when the feature flag is disabled. |

## Returns:
- The result of either the `on()` or `off()` function based on the current state of the feature flag specified by `feature`.

## Usage Example

```typescript jsx
import { ToggleFeaturesComponent } from '@/shared/components/ToggleFeaturesComponent';
import { RedesignedArticleDetails } from '@/features/redesigned/RedesignedArticleDetails';
import { DeprecatedArticleDetails } from '@/features/deprecated/DeprecatedArticleDetails';

export const ArticleDetailsWrapper = () => (
    <ToggleFeaturesComponent
        feature="isAppRedesigned"
        on={<RedesignedArticleDetails />}
        off={<DeprecatedArticleDetails />}
    />
);
```

## Conclusion 
The `ToggleFeaturesComponent` is an essential tool for managing feature flags in React applications, offering a consistent and maintainable approach to conditional rendering. By abstracting feature flag logic into a reusable component, it enhances code maintainability, reduces duplication, and simplifies feature toggling. Whether you're managing new feature rollouts or deprecating old features, `ToggleFeaturesComponent` provides a robust solution for handling these variations in a React application.
