# Documentation for `setupApiStore`

## Overview 
The `setupApiStore` function is designed to configure and provide a Redux store instance tailored for API integration using Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`). 
It sets up a Redux store with specified reducers and middleware, facilitating seamless integration with APIs through standardized Redux actions and reducers.


## Imports and Dependencies
```typescript
import {
    AnyAction,
    combineReducers,
    configureStore,
    EnhancedStore,
    Middleware,
    Reducer,
} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
```
- `AnyAction`: A type from Redux Toolkit representing any action object dispatched in the Redux store.
- `combineReducers`: A function from Redux Toolkit that merges multiple reducer functions into a single reducing function, managing different slices of the state.
- `configureStore`: A utility from Redux Toolkit that sets up a Redux store with good defaults, including middleware and reducer management.
- `EnhancedStore`: A type representing a Redux store that is enhanced with middleware and other functionalities, provided by `configureStore`.
- `Middleware`: A type representing Redux middleware functions that can intercept actions dispatched to the store, allowing for custom behavior (e.g., logging, async operations).
- `Reducer`: A type for Redux reducer functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.
