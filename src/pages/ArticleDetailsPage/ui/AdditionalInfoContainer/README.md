# AdditionalInfoContainer

## Overview
The **`AdditionalInfoContainer`** component displays additional information about an article, including author details, creation date, and view count. It conditionally renders either a loading skeleton or the actual content based on the data fetching state. The component utilizes the `AdditionalInfoContainerSkeleton` for loading states and `ArticleAdditionalInfo` for displaying the actual content.

## Props
The `AdditionalInfoContainer` component does not accept any props.

## Features
1. **Conditional Rendering**: Displays a loading skeleton while the article data is being fetched and shows the actual content once the data is available.
2. **Loading State**: Uses the `AdditionalInfoContainerSkeleton` component to provide a visual placeholder during data loading, maintaining user engagement and visual consistency.
3. **Content Display**: Once the data is loaded, it renders the `ArticleAdditionalInfo` component, which shows the author's details, publication date, and view count within a styled `Card` container.
4. **Responsive Design**: The component is designed to fit various screen sizes and container widths, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices.

## Usage Example
```typescript jsx
import { AdditionalInfoContainer } from '@/pages/ArticleDetailsPage';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div className="additional-info-container">
            <AdditionalInfoContainer />
            {/* The AdditionalInfoContainer component displays supplementary information about the article */}
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Conclusion
The `AdditionalInfoContainer` component is essential for presenting additional information about an article in a user-friendly manner. It enhances the user experience by providing a loading skeleton during data fetching and a well-structured content display once the data is available. By integrating conditional rendering and responsive design, the component ensures a seamless and engaging experience for users, maintaining visual consistency and providing clear feedback during the content loading phase.
