## Features
1. **User Settings Management**: Provides an interface for users to customize their settings, including UI design preferences.

2. **Consistent Layout**: Utilizes the `Page` component to maintain a consistent and structured layout across the application.

3. **Component Memoization**: The `SettingsPage` is memoized using `React.memo` to optimize rendering performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

4. **Lazy Loading**: The `SettingsPageAsync` component is lazy-loaded to optimize the initial load time of the application, improving performance and user experience.

The `SettingsPage` module is essential for providing a dedicated interface for user settings management. 
By leveraging the `SettingsContainer` component, it ensures that users can easily customize their preferences, including UI design options. 
The use of the `Page` component for a consistent layout, memoization for performance optimization, and lazy loading for improved load times makes the `SettingsPage` module an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing user settings.
Additionally, the `SettingsPageSkeleton` component enhances the user experience by providing a visual indication during loading states, ensuring a smooth and responsive interface.
