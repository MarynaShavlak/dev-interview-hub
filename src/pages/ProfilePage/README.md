# Page ProfilePage Documentation

## Overview
The **`ProfilePage`**  module is responsible for rendering a user's profile page, where users can view their own profile or that of another user. Built according to the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology, this module efficiently manages and presents profile-related functionality within a cohesive, consistent layout. It allows for profile viewing, editing (if applicable), and leverages performance optimization techniques like component memoization and lazy loading.

# Module Structure

The `ProfilePage`  module is organized into UI components and an entry point, as shown below:
```text
ProfilePage/
├── ui/
│   ├── ProfileContainer/
│   │   └── ProfileContainer.tsx
│   ├── ProfilePage/
│   │   └── ProfilePage.tsx
└── index.ts
```

## Detailed Description

### 1. `ui/`: UI components
- **`ProfileContainer/`**:
    - [**ProfileContainer.tsx**](./ui/ProfileContainer/README.md): Main container managing user profile data, rendering information, and enabling edits when the current user views their own profile.

- **`ProfilePage/`**:
    - [**ProfilePage.tsx**](./ui/ProfilePage/ProfilePage.tsx): Main component that displays a user's profile, integrating profile viewing and editing functionalities.


### 2. `index.ts`
- Entry point for the `ProfilePage` module, exporting the components for easy use throughout the application.

## Public API
- **Components**:
    - `ProfilePage`: Lazy-loaded version of `ProfilePage`, improving initial load times by loading the component only when needed.

## Conclusion
The `ProfilePage` module is essential for providing a seamless user experience for viewing and editing profile information. By leveraging the `ProfileContainer`, it ensures that profile data is dynamically loaded and easily editable. The use of the Page component guarantees a consistent layout throughout the application. Additionally, performance is optimized through component memoization and lazy loading, ensuring fast load times and smooth interaction. This makes the ProfilePage module an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing user profiles.
