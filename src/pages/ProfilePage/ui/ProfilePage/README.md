# ProfilePage

## Overview
The **`ProfilePage`** module is responsible for displaying a user's profile page, where they can view and edit their own profile or view the profile of another user. According to the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology, this page module is designed to manage and present the profile-related functionalities within a consistent and cohesive layout.

## Type Definition
```typescript
interface ProfilePageProps {
    className?: string;
}
```

## Props
The **`ProfilePage`** component accepts the following props:

| Prop       | Type       | Required / Optional | Description                                          |
|------------|------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `className` | `string`   | Optional             | Custom class name for additional styling.           |

## Features
1. **User Profile Display**: Shows the profile information of the current user or another user, depending on the URL parameters.

2. **Editable Profile**: Integrates the `ProfileContainer` component, allowing the current user to edit their profile details if they are viewing their own profile.

3. **Consistent Layout**: Utilizes the `Page` component to maintain a consistent and structured layout across the application.

4. **Component Memoization**: The `ProfilePage` is memoized using `React.memo` to optimize rendering performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

5. **Lazy Loading**: The `ProfilePageAsync` component is lazy-loaded to optimize the initial load time of the application, improving performance and user experience.


## Conclusion
The `ProfilePage` module is a crucial part of the application, providing users with a dedicated interface to view and edit profile information. 
By leveraging the `ProfileContainer` component, it ensures that the profile data is dynamically loaded and editable, offering a seamless user experience. 
The use of the `Page` component for a consistent layout, memoization for performance optimization, and lazy loading for improved load times makes the `ProfilePage` module an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing user profiles.
