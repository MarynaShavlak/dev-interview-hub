## useVirtuosoGrid Hook

The `useVirtuosoGrid` hook is a custom React hook designed to manage the scroll position of a Virtuoso grid component based on a given article index. It provides a reference to the Virtuoso grid handle and automatically scrolls the grid to a specified index when the index changes. This hook is useful for applications that need to synchronize scroll positions with dynamic content or user interactions.

## Parameters

- **`scrollStopArticleIndex`** (`number`): The index of the article to which the grid should scroll. This value determines the scroll position of the grid when it changes.

## Returns

- **`virtuosoGridRef`** (`React.RefObject<VirtuosoGridHandle>`): A reference to the Virtuoso grid handle. This reference can be used to interact with the grid component, such as controlling its scroll behavior.

## Internal Behavior

1. **Reference**:
    - **`virtuosoGridRef`**: A `React.RefObject` for accessing the Virtuoso grid handle. This reference allows you to control the grid's scroll behavior.

2. **Effect**:
    - **`useEffect`**: Sets up a side effect that triggers a scroll to the specified index when `scrollStopArticleIndex` changes. The scrolling is performed smoothly using `scrollToIndex` with a slight delay to ensure the grid is fully rendered.

3. **Timeout**:
    - **`setTimeout`**: Used to delay the execution of the scroll action to ensure it occurs after the grid has rendered and the DOM updates are completed.

## Usage Example

```typescript jsx
import { useVirtuosoGrid } from '@/features/scroll/useVirtuosoGrid';

const ArticleGridView = ({ scrollStopArticleIndex }: { scrollStopArticleIndex: number }) => {
    const virtuosoGridRef = useVirtuosoGrid(scrollStopArticleIndex);

    return (
        <div ref={virtuosoGridRef} style={{ height: '500px', overflowY: 'auto' }}>
            {/* Render the Virtuoso grid component */}
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Conclusion
The useVirtuosoGrid hook provides an effective solution for managing the scroll position of a Virtuoso grid in a React application. By leveraging this hook, developers can ensure that the grid component automatically scrolls to a specified index when needed, offering a seamless and responsive user experience. This hook abstracts away the complexity of scroll management, making it easier to synchronize grid views with dynamic content and user interactions.
Using `setTimeout` in the `useVirtuosoGrid` hook is essential for ensuring that the Virtuoso grid scrolls to the correct index after rendering. This approach compensates for the absence of an `initialTopMostItemIndex` prop in `VirtuosoGrid`, ensuring a smooth and accurate restoration of scroll positions when users return to the articles page. It provides a reliable way to manage dynamic content and layout changes while maintaining a seamless user experience.
