# ArticleInfiniteListError

## Overview
The **`ArticleInfiniteListError`** component is designed to display an error message when there is an issue fetching or displaying a list of articles. It is used to inform users of problems encountered during the article retrieval process, ensuring they are aware of any issues affecting content loading. This component leverages localization for error messaging and adapts its visual presentation based on feature flags to provide a consistent and user-friendly error display.

## Props
The `ArticleInfiniteListError` component does not accept any props.

## Features

1. **Localized Error Messaging**: Utilizes the `useTranslation` hook to fetch the appropriate error message based on the current language settings. This ensures that users receive error messages in their preferred language, enhancing the accessibility and user experience.

2. **Adaptive Layout**: Incorporates the `ToggleFeaturesComponent` to conditionally render the error message using either a redesigned or traditional text component. The layout adapts based on the `isAppRedesigned` feature flag, providing flexibility in the visual presentation of error messages.

3. **Clear Error Display**: Displays the error message centrally aligned with appropriate styling to ensure that the error is prominently visible. This approach helps users easily identify and understand that an issue has occurred with the article list.


## Usage Example
```typescript jsx
import { ArticleInfiniteListError } from '@/components/ArticleInfiniteListError';

const ArticleListPage = () => {
    return (
        <div className="article-list-page">
            {/* Other components for rendering articles */}
            <ArticleInfiniteListError />
            {/* The ArticleInfiniteListError component displays an error message if there is an issue fetching or displaying the list of articles */}
        </div>
    );
};
```
