# ViewSelectorContainer

## Overview
The **`ViewSelectorContainer`** component acts as a container for the `ArticleViewSelector` component, facilitating the selection of article view modes (e.g., list or grid). It utilizes the `useArticleFilters` custom hook to retrieve the current view mode and a handler function to update the view mode. By managing the state and handler integration, this component ensures that the `ArticleViewSelector` receives the necessary props to function correctly and provide an intuitive user experience for selecting different article views.

## Props
The **`ViewSelectorContainer`** component accepts the following props:

| Prop        | Type       | Required / Optional | Description                                               |
|-------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `className` | `string`   | Optional             | Custom class name for additional styling.                 |

## Features
1. **State Management**: Leverages the `useArticleFilters` hook to manage and provide the current article view mode and update handler.

2. **Handlers Integration**: Passes the current view mode and the view mode change handler to the `ArticleViewSelector` component, enabling users to switch between different view modes seamlessly.

3. **Dynamic View Selection**: Ensures that the `ArticleViewSelector` receives the latest view mode and handler, allowing users to change their article view preference dynamically.

## Usage Example
```typescript jsx
import { ViewSelectorContainer } from '@/components/ViewSelectorContainer';

const ArticlesPage = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <ViewSelectorContainer className="customViewSelector" />
            {/* The ViewSelectorContainer manages and provides view mode data to the ArticleViewSelector */}
        </div>
    );
};
```
## Conclusion
The `ViewSelectorContainer` component is pivotal for managing and providing the view mode state and handler to the `ArticleViewSelector` component. By utilizing the `useArticleFilters` hook, it ensures that the component is equipped with the current view mode and the necessary function to change it, delivering a responsive and user-friendly interface for selecting article views. This component plays a crucial role in linking the view mode logic with the user interface, facilitating smooth transitions between different article display modes.
