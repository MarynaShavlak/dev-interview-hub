# ArticleRating Feature

## Overview
The **`ArticleRating`** component allows users to rate and provide feedback on articles. It dynamically adjusts its display based on feature flags to either show the rating functionality or a disabled rating block if the feature is not enabled. The component integrates with the application's redesigned UI and provides a seamless user experience by handling different states such as loading and errors.

## Type Definition
```typescript
export interface ArticleRatingProps {
    className?: string;
    articleId: string;
}
```
## Props
The **`ArticleRating`** component accepts the following props:

| Prop       | Type       | Required / Optional | Description                                          |
|------------|------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `articleId` | `string`   | Required             | Unique identifier for the article to be rated.           |
| `className` | `string`   | Optional             | Custom class name for additional styling.           |

## Features
1. **Dynamic Feature Handling**: Utilizes the `isArticleRatingEnabled` feature flag to toggle between displaying the rating functionality and the `DisabledRatingBlock`.

2. **Redesigned UI Adaptation**: Adjusts the skeleton loader and other UI elements based on whether the redesigned interface (`isAppRedesigned` feature flag) is enabled. This ensures consistency with the application's overall design.

3. **Article Rating and Feedback**: Provides a user interface for submitting article ratings and feedback, with localization support through the `useTranslation` hook.

4. **State Management**: Handles loading and error states gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.

5. **Lazy Loading**: The component is lazy-loaded to optimize performance. By loading the component only when needed, it reduces the initial load time of the application, improving the user experience.



## Usage Example
```typescript jsx
import ArticleRating from '@/features/articleRating';

const ArticlePage = () => (
    <div>
        {/* The ArticleRating component allows users to rate and provide feedback on the article */}
        <ArticleRating articleId="12345" className="my-custom-class" />
    </div>
);
```
