# `ValidateProfileError` Enum

The `ValidateProfileError` enum defines a set of error codes used for validating user profiles. 
Each value in this enum represents a specific type of error that may occur during the profile validation process.

## Enum Values
- `INCORRECT_USER_DATA`: Indicates that the user profile contains data that is incorrect or invalid. This includes fields firstName and lastname that does not meet the required format or criteria.

- `INCORRECT_USERNAME`: Specifies that the username provided is invalid. This error might occur if the username is already taken, does not meet length requirements, or contains prohibited characters.

- `INCORRECT_AGE`: Indicates that the age provided in the user profile is invalid. This error could be due to the age being out of an acceptable range or formatted incorrectly.

- `NO_DATA`: Represents a situation where no data was provided for the profile validation. This error suggests that the necessary information was missing or not submitted.

- `SERVER_ERROR`: Denotes a server-side issue that prevented the profile validation from completing successfully. This error typically implies that there was a problem with the server or backend processing.
