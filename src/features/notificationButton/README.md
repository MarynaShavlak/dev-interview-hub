# NotificationButton

## Overview
The **`NotificationButton`** component provides an interface for displaying notifications to users in both desktop and mobile views. It integrates a notification trigger button that opens a notification drawer or a popover, depending on the device type. This component ensures that users can access their notifications seamlessly across different screen sizes, enhancing user engagement and experience.

## Type Definition 
```typescript
interface NotificationButtonProps {
    className?: string;
}
```

## Props
The **`NotificationButton`** component accepts the following props:

| Prop       | Type       | Required / Optional | Description                                          |
|------------|------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `className` | `string`   | Optional             | Custom class name for additional styling.           |


## Features
1.**Responsive Design**: The component adapts its rendering based on device type, displaying a popover for desktop users and a drawer for mobile users. This ensures an optimal user experience across different devices.

2.**Device Detection**: Leverages **'react-device-detect'** to differentiate between desktop and mobile devices, ensuring that the appropriate notification display method is used.

3.**Notification Trigger**: Utilizes `NotificationButtonTrigger` to handle user interaction. The trigger opens the notification panel (drawer or popover) when clicked.

4.**Drawer Integration**: On mobile devices, notifications are displayed within a `Drawer` component that provides a slide-in panel, making it easy for users to view and interact with their notifications.

5.**Popover Integration**: For desktop users, the notifications are shown in a `BrowserNotificationPopover`, which provides a compact, inline notification view.

6.**State Management**: Manages the visibility of the notification drawer using local state with useState. The drawer's visibility is controlled via `onOpenDrawer` and `onCloseDrawer` functions.

## Usage Example
```typescript jsx
import { NotificationButton } from '@/features/NotificationButton';

const App = () => (
    <div>
        <NotificationButton className="my-custom-class" />
        {/* The NotificationButton component provides access to notifications based on device type */}
    </div>
);
```
## Conclusion
The **`NotificationButton`** component is designed to provide a responsive and intuitive notification experience for users. By integrating both popover and drawer components, it ensures that notifications are accessible and appropriately displayed on different devices. With its flexible design and efficient state management, it enhances user engagement and accessibility across various platforms.
