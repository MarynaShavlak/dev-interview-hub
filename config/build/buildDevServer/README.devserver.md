# Webpack Development Server Configuration

This module exports a function `buildDevServer` that generates a Webpack Dev Server configuration object based on the provided `BuildOptions`. The Dev Server configuration is crucial for setting up a development environment with features such as live reloading and development server integration.

## Function: `buildDevServer`

### Parameters

- **`options: BuildOptions`**: An object containing configuration options, including the port number for the development server.

### Returns

- **`DevServerConfiguration`**: A Webpack Dev Server configuration object that specifies how the development server should behave.

### Configuration Properties

- **`port`**:
    - **Purpose**: Defines the port number on which the development server will run.
    - **Configuration**:
        - `options.port`: Uses the port number specified in `options`, allowing flexibility in choosing the port.

- **`open`**:
    - **Purpose**: Automatically opens the application in the default web browser when the server starts.
    - **Configuration**:
        - `true`: Ensures the application is opened in the browser, providing immediate feedback and testing capabilities.

- **`historyApiFallback`**:
    - **Purpose**: Configures the server to fallback to the index.html file for any 404 responses. This is particularly useful for single-page applications that use client-side routing.
    - **Configuration**:
        - `true`: Ensures that navigation within the app using the HTML5 History API will be correctly handled by the development server.

- **`hot`**:
    - **Purpose**: Enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which allows modules to be updated without a full page reload.
    - **Configuration**:
        - `true`: Activates HMR, improving the development workflow by preserving the application state during code changes.

## Usage

The `buildDevServer` function provides a streamlined setup for the Webpack Dev Server, tailored for development needs. By configuring features such as automatic browser opening, history API fallback, and hot module replacement, it enhances the development experience and facilitates efficient testing and debugging.
